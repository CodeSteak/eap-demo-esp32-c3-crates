This includes:
* [ring](https://github.com/CodeSteak/eap-demo-esp32-c3-crates/tree/ring-0.17-esp32c3)
* [rustls](https://github.com/CodeSteak/eap-demo-esp32-c3-crates/tree/rustls-0.20.8)
* [sct](https://github.com/CodeSteak/eap-demo-esp32-c3-crates/tree/sct-rs-0.7.0-esp32c3)
* [rustls-webpki](https://github.com/CodeSteak/eap-demo-esp32-c3-crates/tree/webpki-0.100-esp32c3)



# DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION CODE

These are just some quirky hacks to demonstrate that it is possible.
